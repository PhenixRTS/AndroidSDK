# Release notes

### 2020.0.0 ###
#### Features/Improvements
- Introduced stream ended observables to MediaStream and Publisher, allowing for multiple subscribers
- The Publisher will now stop itself and forward the reason to the stream ended observables when the underlying stream ends
- `PCastExpress.publish` will now accept publish options with both a user media stream and constraints specified

#### Fixes
- Fixed video failing to render as a result of `Surface` lifecycle changes
- Fixed crash when network type changes during SDK initialization
- Fixed crash when calling `getUserMedia()` with both audio and video disabled
- The SDK will more reliably reconnect when a network connection is reestablished
- `Observable.subscribe()` now takes an `OnChangedHandler<T>` instead of `OnChangedHandler<Object>`. As a result, callback handlers need to implement `onEvent(T change)` instead of `onEvent(Object change)`.


### 2019.2.3 ###
#### Features/Improvements
- Support for edge authentication tokens
- Added playout delay override API
- Argument-less `withRenderer` API on various options builders has been deprecated. Use `withAudioOnlyRenderer` instead
- `close()` API on SDK objects has been deprecated. Use `dispose()` instead, which does not declare an explicit exception, and is, therefore, easier to use
- MIPS architectures are removed
- Now available as Gradle dependency. See Readme.md for details

#### Fixes
- Room or channel service automatically re-joins after a network disruption
- Fix ScreenGrabber crashes on SecurityException on Android 6+


### 2019.2.2 ###
#### Fixes
- Room participants will no longer leave zombie sessions around when reauthenticating
- Fixed `audio-only` for cases where wildcard tokens are present for channel viewers


### 2019.2.1 ###
#### Features/Improvements
- Lag render statistic via `Renderer.getStats`/`PhenixRenderer.stats`
- Reduced SDK initialization times
- Improved layer switching strategy for MBR streams
- Improved reconnection logic for clients with network outages

#### Fixes
- Fixed memory leak on stop publishing
- Fixed rebuffering telemetry metric
- Fixed rare crash when backgrounding app
- Fixed crash when attempting to subscribe while SDK is being shut down
- Fixed horn-like sound artifact when app returns to foreground
- Fixed resource leak in video rendering code


### 2019.2.0 ###
#### Fixes
- Fix crash during ICE server registration
- Safe creation of an empty renderer from an already stopped ExpressSubscriber 
- Publisher side frame-ready API: Drops frames when overloaded instead of falling behind

#### Features/Improvements
- Audio Echo Cancelation is now available on Android. 

**Note:** AEC needs to be enabled in the RendererOptions in addition to UserMediaOptions. See documentation for more details.


### 2019.0.0 ###
#### Fixes
- Publisher bitrate limitation reason will remain “None” and no longer be set to “PublisherLimited” while recovering from bitrate override
- Normal app termination/exit will no longer trigger sporadic exceptions
- App will no longer crash if we are unable to leave a room while the RoomService is being finalized

### 2018.4.3 ###
#### Features/Improvements
- URIs passed to SDK can now accept leading and trailing whitespaces without causing failures
- Improved chat message observable behavior to ensure that initial callback will always contain most recent chat history

#### Fixes
- Fixed detached functionality when publishing remote streams via express API
- Fixed sporadic DTLS connection issues
- Properly release all resources when stopping an express publisher


### 2018.4.2 ###
#### Features/Improvements
- Improved connection time during SDK initialization.  Results in shorter time-to-first-frame.
- WiFi connected clients are no longer automatically forced through TURN/TCP
- New limitBandwidth API method to limit the maximum bandwidth a client should use for streams

#### Fixes
- Fixed reconnection issues which could occur when devices switch networks or are moved to background and back
- Fixed occasional 5 second hang when SDK is shut down
- Fix for dropping video or audio when consuming streams where one is arriving later than the other
- Fixed automatic resubscription logic when streams are ended with a recoverable reason


### 2018.4.1 ###
#### Features
- SDK is organized as an AAR package for easier integration
- First version of telemetry, providing better visibility into device performance
- Room and channel publish APIs now provide RoomService instance in callback
- Improved connections times when initializing Phenix SDK
- Allow passing of custom HTTP headers for authentication and stream token requests

#### Fixes
- Fixes for various crashes that could occur when shutting down or stopping the Phenix SDK
- Fixed sporadic loss of audio on viewer side
- Fixed exception when unsupported resolution is requested
- Fixed crashes when running SDK in simulator
- Fixed exception when activity gets destroyed while renderer is still active
